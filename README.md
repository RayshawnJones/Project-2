## Overview

Develop a responsive Time Tracking Dashboard that allows users to:
Adaptively view the layout according to their device’s screen size.
Experience interactive hover states on all elements.
Toggle between Daily, Weekly, and Monthly statistics.
Expected Behavior
Display text indicating the time spent in the previous period, dynamically changing based on the selected timeframe:
Daily: “Yesterday - X hrs”
Weekly: “Last Week - X hrs”
Monthly: “Last Month - X hrs”

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats
